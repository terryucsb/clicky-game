#Instructions#
1 - Check out the example solution and study the app's basic functionality.

2 - Create a new React application using Create React App.

3 - The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

4 - The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5 - Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

6 - Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7 - When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
